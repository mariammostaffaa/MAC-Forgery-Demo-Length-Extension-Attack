# MAC-Forgery-Demo-Length-Extension-Attack
Python demo of a MAC forgery via length extension attack on MD5-based MACs using hashpumpy. Includes vulnerable and secure servers to show how naive MACs fail and HMAC defends against the attack. Useful for learning about cryptographic flaws in message authentication.
